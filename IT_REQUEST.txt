Subject: Request: Azure App Registration for Leave Tracker Application

Hi IT Team,

I'm using a Leave Tracker application that needs to read PTO request emails from Outlook. I need an Azure AD app registration created with the following specifications:

**Application Details:**
- Name: Leave Tracker Email Sync
- Type: Single tenant (Deloitte O365D only)
- Purpose: Read emails from my mailbox to automatically track PTO requests

**Required API Permissions (Microsoft Graph - Application permissions):**
- Mail.Read (to read emails from monitored inbox)
- User.Read.All (to read user information)

**Admin Consent:** Required

**What I need from you:**
After creating the app registration, please provide me with:
1. Application (client) ID
2. Directory (tenant) ID
3. Client Secret (value, not the ID)
4. Confirm that admin consent has been granted

**Monitored Email:** anaid@deloitte.com

**Security Notes:**
- The application runs locally on my machine
- Credentials will be stored in a local .env file (not committed to source control)
- Only reads emails, does not send or modify anything
- Only accesses emails with PTO-related keywords (PTO, leave, vacation)

Please let me know if you need any additional information or have security concerns.

Thank you!
